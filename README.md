# Flight Analytics Dashboard — uOttawa Hackathon 2026

Real-time airspace conflict detection, hotspot analytics, and multi-aircraft visualization.

## 📦 Overview

This project simulates 250–1000 Canadian flights, detects multi-aircraft conflicts using a Python trajectory engine, and visualizes everything on an interactive React + Leaflet dashboard.

The goal is to provide a fast, visual, and analytics-driven way to understand complex airspace behavior.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React (Vite)
- React Router DOM (routing)
- Leaflet + React-Leaflet (flight route visualization)
- Firebase (optional, for data storage)
- Custom Vite dev server middleware for Python execution (`/api/resolve-conflicts`)

### Backend / Simulation

- Python 3 (standard library only - no external dependencies)
- FlightPath.py - Main conflict detection engine
- ConflictFinder.py - Conflict detection algorithms
- ConflictResolver.py - Conflict resolution logic
- iterative_resolve.py - Iterative conflict resolution
- Conflict generation → `src/db/conflicts.json`

### Build Tools

- Node.js
- Git + GitHub
- JSON for data handling

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ajay757/uO-hackathon2026.git
cd uO-hackathon2026
```

### 2️⃣ Install Node Modules

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Install Python (Required for Conflict Detection)

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

**Note:** All Python dependencies are part of the standard library (json, math, datetime, os, subprocess, sys). No additional packages need to be installed.

### 4️⃣ Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App will start at:
👉 http://localhost:5173

### 5️⃣ Running Conflict Analysis (Python)

**Generate Conflicts:**

To generate conflicts from flight data, run:

```bash
cd src/db
python3 FlightPath.py
```

This will:
- Read flight data from `flights.json`
- Generate `simulation_state.json`
- Detect conflicts and write them to `conflicts.json`

**Note:** The dashboard loads conflicts from `conflicts.json` when you click "Run Analysis". Make sure to generate conflicts first using the command above, or the conflicts.json file should already exist in `src/db/`.

**Conflict Resolution API:**

The dashboard includes a conflict resolution feature that uses the `/api/resolve-conflicts` endpoint (configured in `vite.config.js`). This automatically runs `iterative_resolve.py` to resolve conflicts iteratively.

## ▶️ How to Use the App

### Dashboard

- Explore overall flight metrics
- View hotspots and busiest airspace
- Click "Run Analysis" to load and display conflicts from `conflicts.json`
- Use "Resolve Conflicts" to run iterative conflict resolution via the API endpoint

### Conflict Resolver

- Click any conflict row
- View all aircraft in that conflict
- See routes, airports, waypoints
- Time after departure is displayed
- Works for 2–6+ aircraft
